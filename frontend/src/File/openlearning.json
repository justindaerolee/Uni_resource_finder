             "summary": "The problem with today's education is that most educators are still teaching the way they were taught in the past.  Hence, there is a need to revisit the traditional conception of teaching and explore new ways to redesign learning so that it is relevant to the growing challenges of preparing our students to function in tomorrow's world. This course is designed to facilitate pariticipants to redefine their conceptions of teaching and redesign their students' learning experiences so that they meet the needs of the 21st century education.RTRL is equivalent to a 5 credit hours course offered as a self-paced mode over a period of 24 weeks. There are 12 modules, hence we recommend that you spend about 2 weeks for each module. Since the course will be very much 'hearts-on' and 'minds-on' (Modules 1-6) as well as 'hands-on' (Modules 7-12), course participants are expected to complete various activities set for each module.At the moment, the course is offered in a self-paced mode. Hence, although the contents are structured for easy internalization, participants can explore them according to their preferred learning pathways.    ",

             "summary": "T  he usage of technology has become increasingly prominent in education these days, evident by the infrastructure and facilities in schools ranging from tablets to high speed internet connectivity. This book is written to complement the effort of promoting the integration of technology with education, focusing on the basic knowledge of technology which an educator should know.  I started this MOOC with a brief history of computers to illustrate the rapid development of technology and how lives are affected and dependent on it. The later chapters help novice learners in understanding the use of technology for educational purposes while guiding readers on the terms commonly used in instructional technology. This MOOC also comprised chapters guiding teachers in utilizing resources available in the internet, with a hope to alleviate teachers burden by working efficiently through collaboration and idea sharing.   With the integration of technology, there is a need for a different classroom management compared to the traditional ones. Hence, this book also covers on the skills needed by teachers in order to manage an IT classroom promoting more effective classroom management. Realising that integrating technology in education is not all beneficial without a single flaw, I also touched on few issues related to instructional technology such as piracy, unequal access and internet security within the essence of education. Other than that, readers will appreciate the myriad diagrams and screenshots included in this book to help readers navigate themselves in making the most out of the content of this book. With the topics written covered most of the necessary, this book ends with anticipations for instructional technology in the future.   I certainly   hope that this MOOC will provide a resource to advocate for the best possible ways of how learning can be carried out effectively with technology. My goal is that the ideas in this book will help support educators in deriving effective lessons through instructional technology, while also nurturing their sense of joy in learning alongside their teaching.  Lets use the technology to change the way we teach!    ",

This easy identification, with logos and trademarks, became a short cut for quality and trust. People putting their services in the marketplace also became \u2018brand names. This used to a game only for the rich, successful, or notorious. But In the 21st Century anyone participating in the Web has a searchable identity. So whether we like it or not, we have a brand to cultivate.This course provides systematic ways of reviewing and implementing your existing and proposed brand identities, based on psychology and demography.

Rather, the focus is on strategy to drive the use of the technology.Who should take this course?A personal brand can be useful for people needing to announce their presence and get out a message.

But what are the characteristics or skills needed to be an effective 21st century educator? Fundamentally, this entails the need for educators to be aware that they are now dealing with a new 21st  century learners \u2013Digital Natives \u2013 who have different priorities and ways of learning.  The problem is that most educators are still teaching the way they were taught in the past. Hence, there is a need to revisit the traditional conception of teaching often referrred to as Pedagogy and Andragogy.  It is time that we explore new ways to redesign learning so that it is relevant to the growing challenges of preparing our students to function in tomorrow's world. This can be done by first understanding who the Digital Natives are and how they have become self-determined learners .  This new knowledge is called H eutagogy and should be mastered by all educators especially at the higher education level if they desire to create meaningful and engaging learning experiences for the Digital Natives. This MOOC is a in-session/scheduled online professional development course worth 3 credit hours offered over a period of 8 weeks beginning the middle of October 2017. It consists of EIGHT modules designed using engaging and fun learning approaches; namely; i) task-based learning; ii) challenge-based learning, iii) gamified learning, and iv) crowd-sourced contents.

Leveraging on the internet, the content of the course can now be provided typically on an online learning platform and the students are expected to study the materials prior coming to the classroom.

Designed and executed properly, Flipped classroom could be the key to a total classroom makeover.This short course will demonstrate my own approach to flipping the classroom, changing the way we teach and the way students learn.

The topics to be studied include propositional logic, quantifiers and the validity of a proposition. In addition there will be a brief notes on set theory followed by ordered pairs, Cartesian multiplication of sets, equivalent relations, functions, partially and totally ordered sets. The next topic to be discussed is about integer and its application. Finally there is an introduction to graph theory and tree.   Learning outcomes  1) Formulate a proposition in words to a symbolic expression and solve the truth value of compound propositions using truth table or laws of logic.  2) Solve problems in discrete structures (set, permutation and combination, and relations) and their relation between them.  3) Apply representation of integers and some algorithms for integer arithmetic.  4) Apply graph and tree techniques  to model and solve problems in information technology.  5) Apply discrete structure techniques to solve problems in information technology.

For the past 15 years, there have been stunning advances in the understanding of stem cells and their possible use in disease conditions. One of the areas where stem cell research has progressed remarkably is in the field of heart disease. Heart disease, as we all know, is one of the major killers in the world today and incidences, particularly in Asia, are rising every day. This course will help you enter the exciting world of stem cells and learn how it is impacting the management of cardiac disease. It will recount what is already known, analyse what the results mean and equip you with the information you need to make sense of this rapidly changing field. The course assumes knowledge of high school biology but we think that this is not essential to the understanding the material.  The course in interactive, so you will be able to ask questions and catch up if you find some concepts a little challenging at first.  The course will be of 8 weeks duration and will be interactive and FUN. ",
